## Possible Applications

### 1. Strengthening Surveillance System

#### 1.1. Automated Adult Mosquito Identification

##### 1.1.1. Why?

###### Benifits
- Reducing the overall cost of the global entomological surveillance network
**Conducting entomological surveillance often require trained entomologist.** And training a quanlified entomologist require vast amount of investment. 

- Improving data quality
With the accumulation of vector images, the performance of AI model will gradually increase. Finally, it could approach human expert level. The performance of the final model would 
artificial intelligence program can do it more reliably than most humans.

quickly, cheaply and accurately.

###### Comparing to Average Human Performance
Will surpass average human performance.

###### Comparing to Experts Performance

##### 1.1.2. How to do?

###### Data Collection
Mosquito surveillance network
Collect mosquito
Photograph the mosquito
Upload to the database
Idenfitification by the Experts

###### Model -> Performance -> Data -> Model cycle

###### Builing a new data Cooperation mechanism in the AI era
- AI needs a large amount of data
- It's unfeasible for one organization to gather all the
