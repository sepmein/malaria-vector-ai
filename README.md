## Possible Applications

### 1. Strengthening Surveillance System

#### 1.1. Automated Adult Mosquito Identification
picture -> model -> results

##### 1.1.1. Why?

###### Benefits
- Reducing the overall cost of the global entomological surveillance network
**Conducting entomological surveillance often require trained entomologist.** And training a qualified entomologist require vast amount of investment. 
Coverage of the entomological surveillance network.

- Improving data quality
With the accumulation of vector images, the performance of AI model will gradually increase. Finally, it could approach human expert level. The performance of the final model would 
artificial intelligence program can do it more reliably than most humans.

- Improving data feasibility
By providing prediction services to the world, model provider could collect more and more vector pictures. More pictures could increase the precision of the model.

Quickly, cheaply and accurately.

###### Importance of entomological surveillance network
Differences of different mosquitoes
Differences in density, resistance, ability to transmit malaria

###### Comparing to Average Human Performance
Will surpass average human performance.

###### Comparing to Experts Performance

##### 1.1.2. How to do?

###### Data Collection
Using current entomological network
*the current situation of the surveillance networ globally*

Mosquito surveillance network
Collect mosquito
Photograph the mosquito
Upload to the database
Identification by the Experts

###### Model -> Performance -> Data -> Model cycle

###### Building a new data Cooperation mechanism in the AI era
- AI needs a large amount of data
- It's unfeasible for one organization to gather all the
