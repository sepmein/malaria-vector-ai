## Possible Applications

### 1. Strengthening Surveillance System

#### 1.1. Automated Adult Mosquito Identification

Deep-learning software uses artificial neural networks mimicking the brain to allow computers to recognize abstract patterns. In 2012, one concurrent neural network(CNN) model called AlexNet achieved 15.3% error rate(26.2%, second place) in the [ImageNet](http://image-net.org) challenge. ImageNet challenge is a challenge for the computer algorithm to classify on 14M images on 1000 categories. AlexNet was a huge success on the computer vision. Since then, the accuracy of CNN models(GoogleNet, ResNet, SENet) gradually increased, and surpassed the average human levels(2.25% error rate, 2017).

Mosquitoes transmit malaria, yellow fever, dengue and encephalitis. The mosquito entomology surveillance required trained entomologist to identify the mosquito species. The microscopy currently used to quantify the parasites requires well-trained entomologists, and many malaria-prone areas donâ€™t have enough of those, or the resources to train new ones. 

By using CNN models, it's possible to create a web service that could automatically differentiate different species of mosquitoes. Based on the mosquito image(s) given by the user, the online identification model would give the result of classification of the image and the confidence of the results. So anyone that could access to the internet could take pictures of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria and send the photo to the web service and get the identification result.

In the future, it's possible to create a off-line version of these online service.

##### 1.1.1. Why?

###### Benefits
>Quickly, cheaply and accurately.
- Reducing the overall cost of the global entomological surveillance network

    **Conducting entomological surveillance often require trained entomologist.** And training a qualified entomologist require vast amount of investment. The lack of entomologist restrained the ability of the surveillance network to achieve a higher coverage. 

    By automating the identification process, AI could make the surveillance much more easier to implement. The cost of training and salary could be reduced.

- Improving data quality

    The ability of entomologist varies. Automating the process with an intelligent model can alleviate the shortfall of trained personnel in under-resourced countries.

    With the accumulation of vector images, the performance of AI model will gradually increase. Finally, it could approach human expert level. The performance of the final model would 
    
    artificial intelligence program can do it more reliably than most humans.

- Gather more data

    Data is resource in the future. By providing online prediction services globally, model provider could collect more and more vector pictures. More pictures could increase the precision of the model.
